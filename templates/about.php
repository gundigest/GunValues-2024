			<div class='half-page faq'>			
			<p>At Gun Digest we are passionate about Firearms and we know you are too. That’s why we are constantly researching the best firearms information to present to you in Gun Digest Magazine, in our great publications at Gun Digest Books, and online at GunDigest.com We know that there are many ways of living the firearms lifestyle and our goal is to provide you with the information you need to live it your way. At the end of every day, we want you to know guns like we know guns, it’s why we do what we do.</p>
			<p>Our standout annual pricing guide, the Standard Catalog of Firearms has long been revered as the top source in the industry for new and used firearm values. We know you love the Standard Catalog, but weighing in at over 5 pounds it can make for a long day if you’re carrying it around a Gun Show, Auction, or just from dealer to dealer. We wanted to give you a better option, which is how we came up with the idea for the Gun Values by Gun Digest system.</p>
			<p>We designed Gun Values by Gun Digest to be a lightweight mobile-friendly website that gives you the model and pricing data you need anywhere you have an internet connection. Gun Values is designed to be responsive, so it switches easily between your phone and your computer, and looks great on both. It’s also easy to navigate so you can find the model you’re looking for fast and easy. </p>
			<p>Best of all, looking up model information in Gun Values is Free. Take advantage of this great system that has model and series info for virtually every rifle, shotgun, or handgun manufactured in the United States or imported since the early 1800s. Pricing information is available at reasonable rates as a recurring subscription or a one-time fee. </p>
			<p>We hope you enjoy Gun Values by Gun Digest and that it helps you with your firearms lifestyle. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="{$root}contact">Contact Us</a>. </p>
